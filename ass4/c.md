# Assignment 4 - Part C

This graphic portrays a speedometer. It's unlear what the units are on the speedometer.

An audience in the US might assume the units in the graphic are miles per hour. Other countries, however, use metric and their speedometers show kilometers per hour.

The ambugiuty may be removed by: a) labelling the speedoeter with units, or b) adding another unit type to the speedometer, labelling both.

I don't have an internet connection right now, so I can't provide a link to the graphic, but here's an ascii art representation:

```
