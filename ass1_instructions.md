Note the Two Parts of This Assignment--A and B

A. Locate a Web page you believe to be an example of technical communication and describe some of the characteristics that are discussed in Chapter 1. Create a basic and simple listing of the qualities you find in your Web page in any format that you choose (a memo format, a paragraph with vertical listing techniques, etc.).

B. Write a claim (complaint) letter based upon the scenario that follows:

You have been a loyal customer of the Sea-Tasty Company for years with much satisfaction.  However, this afternoon that all changed.  You opened a can of tuna fish to  make a sandwich and discovered a housefly sitting right on top of the tuna.

The formula is simple.  You merely need to begin by expressing a "buffer statement" in the first paragraph.  It could be expressed like the following:  I've been a steady customer of yours for years, but today I have become disappointed.

The next section of your letter will explain the problem; a simple description of your intention to make a sandwich and the discovery of the little critter in the tuna can.  Make sure to remain detached and cool-headed when explaining/describing your discovery.

Finally, you'll want to ask for some type of compensation with the hope that the situation won't be repeated in the future.

Here is the company's information:

Sea-Tasty Tuna Company  

19 Lowry Lane

Morgan Texas, 30361

ATTN: Roberta Smith--Operations Manager

*Note:  Your letter will be shorter and less complex than the example in textbook--page 373.

I prefer that you create one document to submit. In fact, you can merely include the three parts of this assignment on three separate pages within your document.
