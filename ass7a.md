Lenovo, the computer manufacturer, has a website, [lenovo.com](https://lenovo.com). Lenovo's website employs several organizational patterns from our textbook:

**Classification Partition**

Lenovo's website presents general information, such as marketing slogans, first. At the bottom of the page, links are displayed for each of Lenovo's product types: laptops, desktops, etc. The links lead to product list pages, where categories become even more specific. Products are organized by brand on the product list pages.

**Problem Method Solution**

Lenovo's homepage displays a slide show, each slide targets a specific use case. One slide displays a student workspace with a laptop, while another slide features a computer running a video game. Each slide poses a use case (the problem) and a specific product to match (the solution). Clicking the slide loads a descriptive page about how the product solves the specific problem. This website does not mention methods for discovering the problem; the problem is assumed.

**General to specific.**

[Individual product pages](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpad-p/ThinkPad-P52s/p/22TP2WPP52S?IPromoID=LEN561393) follow the General to Specific pattern. A short description is provided initially. Read on and you'll find more a verbose description. Continue on after the reviews to arrive at the most specific info, the table of tech specs.
