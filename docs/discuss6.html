<li><p><strong>How many columns are used in this document? How does the column design affect the readability of the page?</strong></p>
<p>The first document is formatted as a single column. The dense technical content of the first document is difficult to track due to line length.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What type of justification has been used for the text? Was this a wise choice for this page size? Why or why not?</strong></p>
<p>The first document is fully justified, without hyphenation. Full justification is suitable as varying justification spaces are not noticeable within large line widths.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What alignment features, if any, have been used? What problems with alignment, if any, do you see?</strong></p>
<p>In the first document alignment is consistently unused. The first document seems to employ numbered lists, but the lists provide little readability benefit without indentation. The table near the bottom of the first document does not align its second column, hindering its readability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How many levels of headings appear on this page? Are the different levels designed effectively so that they are easy to distinguish? If not, what changes would you make to the design?</strong></p>
<p>The second document uses 2 heading levels, 3 if you count the inline headings e.g. the “Individual Income Taxes” paragraph. The second level heading e.g. “Revenues” is similar to the inline heading, but is still distinguishable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How are rules used on this page? Are they effective? Would you change any of them?</strong></p>
<p>Rules are used to: - separate the graphic from text content - separate the graphic from the graphic’s title - separate text body from citation list</p>
<p>The use of rules are effective and does not require change.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Describe the design of the body text on this page, focusing on columns and alignment. Is the design of the body text effective? Would you change it in any way?</strong></p>
<p>Left justification works well for half width columns; variable spacing is avoided.</p>
<p>One interesting detail is hyphenation. The document seems to employ “smart hyphenation”, where some words are split, while others are wrapped to the next line. For example: “current” is broken into “cur-rent” while “receipts” and “$1.3” are left unsplit.</p></li>
