<p>Instructions Note the Two Parts of This Assignment–A and B</p>
<p>A. Locate a Web page you believe to be an example of technical communication and describe some of the characteristics that are discussed in Chapter 1. Create a basic and simple listing of the qualities you find in your Web page in any format that you choose (a memo format, a paragraph with vertical listing techniques, etc.).</p>
<p>B. Write a claim (complaint) letter based upon the scenario that follows:</p>
<p>You have been a loyal customer of the Sea-Tasty Company for years with much satisfaction. However, this afternoon that all changed. You opened a can of tuna fish to make a sandwich and discovered a housefly sitting right on top of the tuna.</p>
<p>The formula is simple. You merely need to begin by expressing a “buffer statement” in the first paragraph. It could be expressed like the following: I’ve been a steady customer of yours for years, but today I have become disappointed.</p>
<p>The next section of your letter will explain the problem; a simple description of your intention to make a sandwich and the discovery of the little critter in the tuna can. Make sure to remain detached and cool-headed when explaining/describing your discovery.</p>
<p>Finally, you’ll want to ask for some type of compensation with the hope that the situation won’t be repeated in the future.</p>
<p>Here is the company’s information:</p>
<p>Sea-Tasty Tuna Company</p>
<p>19 Lowry Lane</p>
<p>Morgan Texas, 30361</p>
<p>ATTN: Roberta Smith–Operations Manager</p>
<p>*Note: Your letter will be shorter and less complex than the example in textbook–page 373.</p>
<p>I prefer that you create one document to submit. In fact, you can merely include the three parts of this assignment on three separate pages within your document.</p>
