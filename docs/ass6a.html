<h3 id="commentary-on-the-anatomy-of-a-design-theory.">Commentary on “The anatomy of a design theory.”</h3>
<p>The following is a list of features employed in my chosen document, as well as commentary on each feature.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Dividing lines</strong></p>
<p>Overused throughout the document.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Full justification.</strong></p>
<p>Works well as document is full width.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sans serif font.</strong></p>
<p>Sans serif was not as widely used in 2007, so readers may not have been less comforatable reading this document. In 2018 the chice of font is appropriate.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Color</strong></p>
<p>The document uses color to denote decorative elements. Content is black, while the jungle-gym of dividing lines id yellow. The coloring increases readability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Margins</strong></p>
<p>Text is limited to a box within the page. Margins occur outside the box.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Multi-level headers</strong></p>
<p>The document incudes a hierarchy of header types at least two deep. H1 and H2 use the same color and are similarly sized. More difference between headers would increase readability.</p></li>
