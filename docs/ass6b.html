<p>Frontier Internet home page: <a href="https://frontier.com/" class="uri">https://frontier.com/</a></p>
<p>As our textbook states, large, misleading text, followed by correction in small print is unfair to the reader. It wastes the readers time and correction in small print is potentially overlooked by the reader.</p>
<p>Frontier is guilty of a small print correction on their home page. Not only that, but an additional disclaimer points to a legalise document nearly unreadable by the average consumer. Many consumers won’t discover the actual price for Frontier’s internet service until they receive the bill.</p>
