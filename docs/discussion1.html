<p>The document targets Americans. The document has two sides, a front and back; it’s probably some sort of hand-out.</p>
<p>Each section supports the document’s thesis; the document’s goal is to persuade.</p>
<p>The document addresses several problems in support of its thesis. The document provides its thesis as a solution to each problem presented.</p>
<p>The document provides graphics to aid the reader. The document is split into sections for ease of navigation and ease of comprehension. The document contains portions of large text, but those large pieces of text do not convey the full content of the document. Other accessability features seem absent.</p>
<p>The document uses a limited amount of text. Images are used to oviate the need for detailed descriptions. The main point is displayed prominently. A reader need only read the title to learn the document’s primary purpose.</p>
<p>The documents elements are neatly formatted, contributing to a professional appearance.</p>
