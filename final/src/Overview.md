# Overview

Automata, the program, is inspired by Conway's Game of Life. Both feature a 2d grid, on which Finite States are displayed as square cells. Each frame, cells on the grid are updated according a Finite State Machine. This appilcation of FSM's is often referred to as Cellular Automaton. Automata, the program, get's it's name from Cellular Automata.

Automata differs from Conways Game of Life. While cells in Conways Game of Life may occupy one of two states. Automata's cells may occupy one of 521 states. In the section on [State](#state), we'll explore application of the State pattern in the program.
