RE: Assignment 6A - Article features commentary

### Commentary on "The anatomy of a design theory."

The following is a list of features employed in my chosen document, as well as commentary on each feature.

1. **Dividing lines**

	Overused throughout the document.
   
2. **Full justification.**

   Works well as document is full width.
   
3. **Sans serif font.**

   Sans serif was not as widely used in 2007, so readers may not have been less comforatable reading this document. In 2018 the chice of font is appropriate.
   
4. **Color**

   The document uses color to denote decorative elements. Content is black, while the jungle-gym of dividing lines id yellow. The coloring increases readability.
   
5. **Margins**

   Text is limited to a box within the page. Margins occur outside the box.
   
6. **Multi-level headers**

   The document incudes a hierarchy of header types at least two deep. H1 and H2 use the same color and are similarly sized. More difference between headers would increase readability.
